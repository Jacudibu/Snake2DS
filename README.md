# Snake2DS
A Snake Clone for the Nintendo 3DS, inspired by oldschool versions of snake like the one on the first Nokia.

Made with LövePotion. Tons of love for VideahGams for porting LÖVE to 3DS and the whole homebrew community for just being awesome <3

The game is currently still in development, but the stuff on the master branch should be playable.
